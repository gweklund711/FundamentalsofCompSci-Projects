# FundamentalsofCompSci-Projects

This year, as one of my electives, I took the high school credit course of Fundamentals of Computer Science. In this class, I learned about the basics numerous topics in Computer Science. I gained basic knowledge about the structure of a computer, influential computer scientists, binary, data storage and structure, networking, careers in the field, web design, and coding. Along with this, I learned how to write basic programs in HTML and Swift. In the middle of the semester-long course, I spent about a month of class working on different Swift programming assignments. After a month of struggling, I had finally created some nice, basic scripts that performed specific functions. Since I got a lot out of this class, I decided that I would upload these scripts to GitHub. However, I became quite tired of coding in Swift, and I unfortunately forgot to save most of my assignments as projects (I lazily turned in most of them as screenshots). So, I decided to remake all of the scripts in Python, another programming language that I wish to learn about. These attached scripts are the final result of my reconstruction of the programs in a new language.

All of the scripts should work in any Python 3.8 IDE, such as Pycharm.
